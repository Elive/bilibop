bilibop-rules - TODO

  * Provide a script to allow the admin to easily modify the 'filter' in
    lvm.conf, as the lvmconf command does for 'locking_type'.
  * Translate manpages (at least in french and maybe spanish, arabic, russian).
  * Include a udev rules file to manage internal drives by using options to
    set in bilibop.conf or in boot commandline.
  * Use debconf, at least for installation time, instead of silently modify
    grub device.map location or content.
