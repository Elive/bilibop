bilibop (0.3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: in the Suggests: field of bilibop-rules, replace the too
    specific 'grub2' by a list of alternatives (grub-coreboot, grub-efi-amd64,
    grub-efi-ia32, grub-ieee1275 and grub-pc).

  * Add a TODO in bilibop-common, bilibop-rules and bilibop-lockfs.
  * Include /etc/bilibop/bilibop.conf in the bilibop-common binary package.
  * Modify scripts and documentation to take into account that there can be
    more than height loopback devices.

  * bilibop-rules:
    - Fix errors on tests in the initramfs script.
    - Modify grub_device_map_manager to exit with code 0.
  * bilibop-rules.postinst: trigger uevents for block devices.
  * bilibop-rules.bilibop.udev and bilibop_rules_generator: import ID_FS_*
    properties of dm devices in udev database even if udisks is not installed.
  * bilibop_rules_generator: include a new rule for the case the generated
    custom rules file is orphaned.

bilibop (0.3.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Update Build-depends from debhelper (>= 8.0.0) to debhelper (>= 9.0.0).
    - Change some dependencies of binary packages to versioned dependencies:
      udev (>= 167), initramfs-tools (>= 0.99). As for base-files (>= 6.4),
      this is needed by the use of the /run temporary directory in bilibop
      functions or scripts.

  * bilibop-lockfs: modify the initramfs hook: busybox providing its own
    blockdev builtin, don't add /sbin/blockdev in the initramfs if busybox is
    added.
  * extended_partition(): rewrite to avoid direct access on devices (now
    based on udev instead of blkid), move it from lockfs.sh to common.sh
  * lockdev_rootdev_tree():
    - Rewrite it to avoid direct access on devices.
    - Rename it blockdev_root_subtree().
  * lockfs_mount_helper:
    - When the fstype registered in /etc/fstab is 'crypt', 'crypt_LUKS' or
      'crypto_LUKS', set the mounted mapped device as readonly too (and not
      only the underlying device) if asked by BILIBOP_LOCKFS_POLICY != soft.
    - Use LC_ALL=C before the verbose chmod and chown to not depend on the
      locale and simplify the regexp in sed.
  * Put the loop used in the initramfs script to parse and modify fstab in the
    parse_and_modify_fstab() function in lockfs.sh, and call this function in
    the initramfs script.
  * Because LVM tools can bypass 'readonly' settings of block devices and
    reset them as writable, add new functions in lockfs.sh:
    - blacklist_bilibop_devices(): called from the initramfs script.
    - overwrite_lvm_conf(): called from the previous one.
    They are used to disallow management of bilibop (physical and virtual)
    devices by the lvm commands by filtering them in the temporary lvm.conf.
    This avoids breakage of bilibop-lockfs 'hard' policy, at least for the
    root filesystem and its parent devices.
  * Add a new part (3.1.g) in README.Debian to explain what is done, and why.

  * bilibop-common: add a reference to
    http://wiki.debian.org/AdvancedStartupShutdownWithMultilayeredBlockDevices
    in the documentation.
  * Add misc/bugs.txt and misc/lvm2.txt in the documentation.
  * common.sh: remove unneeded command substitution (echo) in the
    undelying_device_from_loop() function.
  * New available options in usr/bin/drivemap:
    - Split --debug to --debug and -x or --set-x
    - Add -p or --mountpoint to explicitly ask to display mountpoints.
    - Add -w or --width to control the width of the output.
  * drivemap.sh: modify _dotline() and _print_line() to include new options.
  * drivemap.1: add the new options in the manpage.
  * _drivemap_primary_partitions(): rewrite to use extended_partition().

  * Fix some typos, unclear sentences and language errors in debian/control,
    in the documentation and in the comments of scripts and functions.
