The goal of this document is to give some tips and tricks about the SWAP
configuration for systems installed on external media.


1. Systems on Flash memory
--------------------------

By "flash memory", we say USB keys, MMC or SD/SDHC cards, SSDs and all what
is not a rotating Hard Disk Drive.

Due to the low limits of rewrites allowed on such devices (commonly some
tens of thousands, sometimes even less), it seems to not be a very good idea
to setup and enable swap areas (block devices or regular files) on them.
If you do it, you have to know that it can dramatically decrease the lifetime
of your drive.

If you have performed an automated install and a swap device is enabled on
your system, you can disable it by at least two ways:

1.1. /etc/fstab and /etc/crypttab

You can delete (or comment) the lines concerning swap devices, or add the
'noauto' option.

1.2. boot commandline

You can add the 'noswap' kernel parameter to your bootloader configuration
file (see grub2.txt).


2. Systems on External HDDs
---------------------------

Such devices have the same rewrites limits than the Internal HDDs. So you can
enable swap areas on them without restriction in terms of lifetime of your
drive. That said, you have to take care about the swap device name in your
configuration files. A good practice is to name devices by the UUID of the
filesystem they content; but it seems some programs don't affect an UUID to
swap filesystems when they create them. Partman, the partitionning tool used
by the Debian Installer, is one of them. To affect an UUID to a swap device,
you can use swaplabel(8) with uuidgen(1), or just recreate the swap filesystem
with mkswap(8) after it has been disabled with swapoff(8).

2.1. Plain text or clear swap (not recommended)

In /etc/fstab, you should have something like:
UUID=12345678-9abc-def0-1234-56789abcdef0 none swap sw 0 0

2.2. Encrypted swap

* In /etc/crypttab, you should have something like:
crypt_swap UUID=12345678-9abc-def0-1234-56789abcdef0 /dev/random swap,offset=8

The "offset=8" option is added to not modify the height first sectors of the
filesystem: 512*8=4096 is the size of the first page of the swap fs, where
the UUID and LABEL are stored. The string 'SWAPSPACE2' is at the end of this
first page. Install the 'haveged' package to use /dev/random as the key,
otherwise use /dev/urandom.

* In /etc/fstab, you should have something like:
/dev/mapper/crypt_swap none swap sw 0 0


3. Use the swap partition of the host computer
----------------------------------------------

It can be useful to set an existing swap partition of the host computer. For
example, if the running system is on a USB stick without swap device on it,
and you absolutely need additional memory for a certain task (unsquashfs a
big file always fails with only 512MB of RAM).

In a such case, the policy should be the following:
A - Use an encrypted swap device to not let easily readable traces of your
    activity on the host computer.
B - Don't modify the swap device in a way that it will be unusable by the
    system installed on the computer.

In the following example, we assume /dev/sda and /dev/sdb are internal HDD,
and /dev/sdc is your pendrive:

# drivemap -d /
/dev/sdc
# blkid -t TYPE=swap -o device
/dev/sdb5
# sfdisk --print-id /dev/sdb 5
82
# dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdb5 bs=512 seek=8
dd: writing `/dev/sdb5': No space left on device
3906243+0 records in
3906242+0 records out
1999995904 bytes (2.0 GB) 1276.3 s, 1.6 MB/s
# cryptsetup --key-file=/dev/random --offset=8 create encswap /dev/sdb5
# mkswap -f /dev/mapper/encswap
Setting up swapspace version 1, size = 1953116 KiB
no label, UUID=0154016f-1fba-4961-a471-0856d06e6c0a
# swapon /dev/mapper/encswap

To properly disable the swap device:

# swapoff /dev/mapper/encswap
# cryptsetup remove encswap

Don't forget the 'seek=8' and '--offset=8' options with dd and cryptsetup
respectively, otherwise the firsts sectors will be overwritten, the UUID
deleted, and if this UUID is used in a configuration file of a system
installed on the computer, unexpetced errors can occur.
